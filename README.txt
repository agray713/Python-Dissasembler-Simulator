This program will take a .txt file of machine code and disassemble it into readable ARMv8 assembly language.

To run this program in a linux terminal do the following:

$python3 team12_project1.py -i <input file directory> -o <desired output filename>

This will create a output file with the ARMv8 code in the same directory as the porgram.
